## Versioning
From version `"jest": "17.0.0"` we are using same MAJOR.MINOR as [`Jest`](https://github.com/facebook/jest).  
For `"jest": "< 17.0.0"` use `"ts-jest": "0.1.13"`. Docs for it see [here](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest/blob/e1f95e524ed62091736f70abf63530f1f107ec03/README.md).

## Usage

To use this in your project, run:
```sh
npm install --save-dev ts-jest
```
Modify your project's `package.json` so that the `jest` section looks something like:
```json
{
  "jest": {
    "transform": {
      ".(ts|tsx)": "<rootDir>/node_modules/ts-jest/preprocessor.js"
    },
    "testRegex": "(/__tests__/.*|\\.(test|spec))\\.(ts|tsx|js)$",
    "moduleFileExtensions": [
      "ts",
      "tsx",
      "js"
    ]
  }
}
```
This setup should allow you to write Jest tests in Typescript and be able to locate errors without any additional gymnastics.

By default `jest` does not provide code coverage remapping for transpiled codes, so if you'd like to have code coverage it needs additional coverage remapping. This can be done via writing custom processing script, or configure `testResultsProcessor` to use built-in coverage remapping in `ts-jest`.
```json
{
  "jest": {
    "transform": {
      ".(ts|tsx)": "<rootDir>/node_modules/ts-jest/preprocessor.js"
    },
    "testResultsProcessor": "<rootDir>/node_modules/ts-jest/coverageprocessor.js"
  }
}
```

> **Note:** If you're experiencing remapping failure with source lookup, it may due to pre-created cache from `jest`. It can be manually deleted, or execute with [`--no-cache`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/troubleshooting.html#caching-issues) to not use those.

## Options
By default this package will try to locate `tsconfig.json` and use its compiler options for your `.ts` and `.tsx` files.  
But you are able to override this behaviour and provide another path to your config for TypeScript by using `__TS_CONFIG__` option in `globals` for `jest`:
```json
{
  "jest": {
    "globals": {
      "__TS_CONFIG__": "my-tsconfig.json"
    }
  }
}
```
Or even declare options for `tsc` instead of using separate config, like this:
```json
{
  "jest": {
    "globals": {
      "__TS_CONFIG__": {
        "module": "commonjs",
        "jsx": "react"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
For all available options see [TypeScript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html).
> **Note:** You can't target `ES6` while using `node v4` in your test environment.
